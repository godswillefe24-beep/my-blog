# Wiring the AI chat into Essence

## 1. Get a free Groq API key
Go to https://console.groq.com/keys, sign up (email or Google, no credit card), create a key.
Free tier as of mid-2026: roughly 30 requests/min, 1,000 requests/day for `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
(check the console for your current limits — Groq adjusts these over time).

## 2. Install the one new dependency (skip if already installed for your login rate limiting)
```
npm install express-rate-limit
```

## 3. Add the API key to your environment
In `.env` (make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`, which it already is for your project):
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
```
On Render: add `GROQ_API_KEY` under your service's **Environment** tab.

## 4. Copy files into your project
```
routes/chat.js                   -> your project's routes/ folder
public/js/chat-widget.js         -> your project's public/js/ folder
public/css/chat-widget.css       -> your project's public/css/ folder
```

## 5. Register the route in server.js
Your project uses `"type": "module"` (ES modules), so use `import`, not `require`:
```js
import chatRouter from './routes/chat.js';
app.use('/api/chat', chatRouter);
```
Note the explicit `.js` extension — ES module imports require it, unlike CommonJS `require`.
Add this alongside your other route registrations, after `express.json()` middleware is set up
(chat.js expects `req.body` to already be parsed as JSON).

## 6. Include the widget on your pages
Add to the `<head>` of index.html / about.html / post pages:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/chat-widget.css">
```
Add near the end of `<body>`, after your other scripts:
```html
<script src="/js/chat-widget.js"></script>
```

## 7. Check the field names in routes/chat.js match your data
`chat.js` reads `data/posts.json` and looks for `title` + (`content` or `body` or `excerpt`
or `summary`) on each post object, and `slug` or `id`. Open `getPostText()` in `chat.js` and
adjust the field names if your posts.json uses different keys than these.

## 8. Test locally, then deploy
```
npm start
```
Open your site, click the chat bubble bottom-right, ask something like "what's your most
recent post about?" — it should retrieve relevant post excerpts and answer using them.
General questions (e.g. "what's a good way to structure a blog post?") will get a normal
assistant answer with no sources cited.

## Streaming upgrade — one infra note (confidence ~85%)
The route now uses Server-Sent Events, holding the HTTP connection open until the full
reply finishes generating. If you deploy behind Render's free tier, this should work fine
for typical reply lengths (a few seconds), but if you ever put a reverse proxy or CDN in
front of the app with an aggressive idle-timeout or response-buffering setting, streaming
can break silently (client just waits, then times out). If replies stop streaming smoothly
after a deploy, that proxy-buffering interaction is the first thing to check — not the
Groq call itself.

## Notes / things I'm not 100% certain about (confidence ~70-80%)
- **Your exact posts.json schema** — I don't have your actual file, so the retrieval code
  guesses at common field names. Test with a content-specific question first; if it never
  finds sources, check field names per step 7.
- **express-rate-limit already installed** — your memory notes mention a rate-limited login
  endpoint, which strongly suggests this package is already a dependency, but confirm before
  assuming `npm install` is a no-op.
- **Groq's exact current rate limits** — these numbers move; verify in your Groq console
  rather than trusting the figures above if this is going into production.
